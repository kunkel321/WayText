WayText is a tool for entering custom-made (by you) boilerplate entries that are first-person narratives such as those that might be written about a student or a patient.  It has a few features that make it optimized for entering text into webforms. WayText, and the accompanying wtSettings app, are written in AutoHotkey v2 code. Please note that the .exe files are not compiled versions of the same-named .ahk files. Rather, they are copies of AutoHotKey.exe that where obtained from the AutoHotkey site, and renamed, to match the .ahk file. Keeping the two in the same folder allows a person to run the code "portably," right from the folder.  It is okay to compile the .ahk files if you want to.  I've left them as is for "transparency" regarding the content of the code. 

Most of the icons are freebie downloads from icons8.com.
